/*
Harry Potter needs help identifying what each house means.

Read a string representing a house and output the following:

* if it is "gryffindor", output "bravery";
* if it is "hufflepuff", output "loyalty";
* if it is "slytherin", output "cunning";
* if it is "ravenclaw", output "intellect";
* otherwise, output "not a valid house".

The problem was taken from the course Introduction to JavaScript and React by Ken McGrady and adapted for our educational platform.
